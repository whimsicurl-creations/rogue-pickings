# Rogue Pickings Website

### Overview
This single page website was created from a design comp for a restaurant.  This website allowed me to work on creating a responsive website with distinctly different layouts depending on the screen size.  The navigation appears differently on tablet and mobile devices.  The three sections that appear side-by-side on desktop convert to stacking into a column for smaller screens.

### Features
This website was created using:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Flexbox
- Media Queries
